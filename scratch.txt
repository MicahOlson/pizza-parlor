Pizza Parlor:

"A website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost."

"Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order."
	toppings (
		cheese (base),
		extra cheese, 
		Meats
			pepperoni,
			sausage,
			canadian bacon,
		Vegs
			artichoke,
			pineapple,
			onion
	)
	size of pie (small, medium, large, jumbo)

--- OBJECTS ---
"Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size."
Pizza()	
	toppings = []
	size = ""

Enhancement idea - add a pricing book to give each topping individual pricing and allow the pizza parlor to apply different pricing schemes, like peak, holiday or promotional pricing
PriceBook object {
	each topping = prices
	each size and its price
}



--- BEHAVIORS ---
"Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this."
Pizza.getCost()
	Overall cost will equal 
		price of selected size += sum of all topping prices (start with all toppings having same price)


PriceBook.addToppingPrice()
PriceBook.addSizePrice()
